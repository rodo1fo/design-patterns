# Samples of Design Patterns in C#
This project is based on book [Design Patterns in C#](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Hands-Real-World-Examples/dp/1484236394)

1. Creational
    * **Singleton**: Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

    * **Builder**:  Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction processes can create different representations.

    * **Prototype**: Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

    * **Factory**: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The Factory Method pattern lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

    * **Abstract Factory**: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

2. Structural

    * **Proxy**: Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

    * **Decorator**: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

    * **Adapter**: Convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. The Adapter pattern lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

    * **Facade**: Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

    * **Composite**: Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly

    * **Bridge**: Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

3. Behavioral

    * **Visitor**: Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.



### Differences between Adapter, Facade, Proxy

* **Adapter**: Adapts a given class/object to a new interface. The object is wrapped by a conforming adapter object and passed around. The problem we are solving here is that of non-compatible interfaces.

* **Facade**: Is more like a simple gateway to a complicated set of functionality. You make a black-box for your clients to worry less i.e. make interfaces simpler.

* **Proxy**: Provides the same interface as the proxied-for class and typically does some housekeeping stuff on its own. 
(So instead of making multiple copies of a heavy object X you make copies of a lightweight proxy P which in turn manages X and translates your calls as required.) 
You are solving the problem of the client from having to manage a heavy and/or complex object.
