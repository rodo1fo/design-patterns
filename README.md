# Samples of Design Patterns in C#
This project is based on book [Design Patterns in C#](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Hands-Real-World-Examples/dp/1484236394)

1. Creational
    * **Singleton**: Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
    * **Builder**:  Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction processes can create different representations.
    * **Prototype**: Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
    * **Factory**: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The Factory Method pattern lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
