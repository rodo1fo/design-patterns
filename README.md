# Samples of Design Patterns in C#
This project is based on book [Design Patterns in C#](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Hands-Real-World-Examples/dp/1484236394)

1. Creational
    * **Singleton**: Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
    * **Builder**:  Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction processes can create different representations.
    * **Prototype**: Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
    * **Factory**: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The Factory Method pattern lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
    * **Abstract Factory**: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
2. Structural
    * **Proxy**: Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
    * **Decorator**: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
    * **Adapter**: Convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. The Adapter pattern lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
